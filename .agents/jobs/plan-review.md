# Plan Review

## Checklist

- Did you make sure the plan actually exists and the users didn't make a mistake?

## Algorithm

Review the entire plan and its steps using the following algorithm:

1. Review the plan brief file to ensure that the plan title, brief specification, and steps are clear and well-defined and that all questions are answered.
2. For each step in the plan, if any exist, review the corresponding step file to ensure that the step title, step specification, and tasks are clear and well-defined and that all questions are answered. If no step files exist, skip this step.
3. Identify any inconsistencies, gaps, or areas that need further clarification in the plan or its steps.
4. If any issues are found, fill out the identified gaps or inconsistencies as questions in the plan or step files.
5. Prompt the user to answer the first unanswered question before proceeding to the next question. Identify if the user's answer is sufficient to answer the question, and if not, ask follow-up questions to clarify the answer. If the answer can address multiple questions, mark them as answered, adding corresponding answers to those questions. If the question can't be answered based on user input or the user instructs to, instead of the answer, explain why the answer is not known (starting with "TBD", i.e., "TBD: We will determine how to approach it after testing the prototype. The problem is...").
6. Wait for all the questions to be answered before proceeding to the next step. If any question is still marked as "TODO", do not proceed until it is resolved. Skip "TBD" questions.
7. Document any additional notes or considerations relevant to the plan or its steps in corresponding files.
8. Repeat steps 1-7 until the plan and all its steps are thoroughly reviewed and refined.
9. Wait for explicit user instructions to proceed to the next job.
